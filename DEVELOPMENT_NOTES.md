# Development Notes

*My approach to building the Virtual Energy Trading Platform take-home. Documenting how I think through problems and make decisions.*

## How I Approached the Assignment

**First step**: Read through the requirements carefully. "Depth over breadth" was clear - better to build one thing really well than multiple incomplete features. The note about documenting decisions and process told me they want insight into my thinking, not just the end result.

**My approach**: Build a complete day-ahead market trading system with real market data integration. Focus on demonstrating I can handle complex requirements and deliver production-quality code.

## Technical Decisions I Made

### Backend First Approach
Started with **FastAPI + Python** because:
- Python has strong libraries for financial/quantitative work
- FastAPI is modern, has good async support for real-time data
- Assignment mentioned it specifically
- GridStatus has a Python SDK

Could have gone React-first, but I wanted to nail the business logic before worrying about UI.

### Data Strategy
**Decision**: Use real GridStatus.io API with smart fallbacks
**Why**: Shows I can integrate with external APIs (important skill) but also that I think about reliability. Demo needs to work even if their API is down.

**Fallback approach**: Instead of random fake data, I calculate realistic price patterns based on actual energy market behavior (peak hours, etc.). Shows domain understanding.

### Frontend Architecture
**React + TypeScript + Arco Design**:
- TypeScript for type safety in financial calculations
- Arco Design was specified - hadn't used it before but similar to Ant Design
- React Query for data fetching - excellent for caching and real-time updates

**Component structure**: Simple but well-organized. Each component has a single responsibility.

## Problems I Solved

### Real-time Data Challenge
Energy markets update every 5 minutes. Need WebSocket for real-time feel but HTTP polling as backup. Implemented both with automatic fallback.

**Key insight**: Always plan for network issues. WebSocket connections fail, APIs go down, connectivity varies.

### 11am Cutoff Rule
This was trickier than it looked. Can't just check if it's before 11am because:
- Which timezone? (CAISO is Pacific)
- What about submitting for tomorrow vs today?
- Daylight savings?

**My solution**: Proper timezone handling with clear validation messages. Frontend shows immediate feedback, backend enforces the rule.

### P&L Calculations
Core formula is simple: `(RTM_price - DAM_price) Ã— quantity`

But implementation details matter:
- What about negative prices? (Yes, energy can be negative)
- How do you aggregate 5-minute RTM data into hourly DAM positions?
- How do you show this clearly to traders?

**My approach**: Keep the math simple and transparent. Show the breakdown so users understand where numbers come from.

## UI/UX Decisions

### Dark Theme Trading Interface
**Reasoning**: Professional trading platforms use dark themes - Bloomberg, energy desks, etc. Reduces eye strain during long sessions.

**Color scheme**: Green/red for P&L (standard), blue for prices, yellow for selected data. Clear and functional.

### Information Layout
**Goal**: Put everything traders need on one screen
- Market stats at top (quick overview)
- Price chart in center (main analysis tool)
- Bid entry on right (workflow optimization)
- Positions table below (P&L monitoring)

**Layout rationale**: Mirrors actual trader workflow - monitor prices, enter orders, track P&L.

### Form Design
**Challenge**: Arco Design's validation caused app crashes
**Solution**: Manual validation with user-friendly notifications instead of error states

**Takeaway**: Sometimes it's better to work around library limitations than fight them.

## What I Prioritized

### Must-haves
1. **Correct P&L math** - This is the core value proposition
2. **11am cutoff enforcement** - Critical business rule
3. **Real market data integration** - Shows API skills
4. **Professional UI** - Needs to look like something traders would use

### Nice-to-haves I included
- CSV export for data analysis
- Multiple timeframes (1D/7D/30D)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Responsive design

### What I deliberately skipped
- User authentication (not relevant for this demo)
- Database persistence (in-memory sufficient for take-home)
- Multiple markets (depth over breadth)
- Complex order types (focused on core functionality)

## Reliability Approach

**Philosophy**: Demo needs to work no matter what
- Backend down? Frontend still functions with calculated data
- API rate limited? Smart caching prevents issues
- WebSocket disconnected? Falls back to HTTP polling
- Form validation errors? Graceful handling with clear messages

**Why this approach**: Demos need to work reliably. Better to have a solid, simple implementation than a complex one that fails.

## Code Quality Approach

**TypeScript strict mode**: Zero `any` types. Financial apps need type safety.

**Error handling**: Every API call, every user input, every edge case has proper handling.

**Clean architecture**: Clear separation between business logic, API calls, and UI components.
