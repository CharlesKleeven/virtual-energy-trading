# Development Notes

*My approach to building the Virtual Energy Trading Platform take-home. Documenting how I think through problems and make decisions.*

## How I Approached the Assignment

**First step**: Read through the requirements carefully. "Depth over breadth" was clear - better to build one thing really well than multiple incomplete features. The note about documenting decisions and process told me they want insight into my thinking, not just the end result.

**My approach**: Build a complete day-ahead market trading system with real market data integration. Focus on demonstrating I can handle complex requirements and deliver production-quality code.

## Technical Decisions I Made

### Backend First Approach
Started with **FastAPI + Python** because:
- Python has strong libraries for financial/quantitative work
- FastAPI is modern, has good async support for real-time data
- Assignment mentioned it specifically
- GridStatus has a Python SDK

Could have gone React-first, but I wanted to nail the business logic before worrying about UI.

### Data Strategy
**Decision**: Use real GridStatus.io API with smart fallbacks
**Why**: Shows I can integrate with external APIs (important skill) but also that I think about reliability. Demo needs to work even if their API is down.

**Fallback approach**: Instead of random fake data, I calculate realistic price patterns based on actual energy market behavior (peak hours, etc.). Shows domain understanding.

### Frontend Architecture
**React + TypeScript + Arco Design**:
- TypeScript for type safety in financial calculations
- Arco Design was specified - hadn't used it before but similar to Ant Design
- React Query for data fetching - excellent for caching and real-time updates

**Component structure**: Simple but well-organized. Each component has a single responsibility.

## Problems I Solved

### Real-time Data Challenge
Energy markets update every 5 minutes. Need WebSocket for real-time feel but HTTP polling as backup. Implemented both with automatic fallback.

**Key insight**: Always plan for network issues. WebSocket connections fail, APIs go down, connectivity varies.

### RTM Data Overload Problem
30 days of RTM data at 5-minute intervals = 8,640 data points. This was overwhelming both the API and chart rendering.

**Challenge**: Users couldn't load 30D view when RTM was selected
**Root cause**: Too much data for browser and API to handle efficiently
**Solution**: Dynamic UI that limits RTM/Both modes to 1D and 7D only, with 30D available for DAM-only analysis

**UX insight**: Better to guide users toward working combinations than let them discover failures

### 11am Cutoff Rule
Can't just check if it's before 11am because:
- Which timezone? (CAISO is Pacific)

**My solution**: Proper timezone handling with clear validation messages. Frontend shows immediate feedback, backend enforces the rule.

### P&L Calculations
Core formula: **Sum of 12 five-minute intervals** within each hourly DAM contract.

Each interval: `(RTM_price - DAM_price) × quantity`
Total P&L: `Σ((RTM_price - DAM_price) × quantity)` for all 12 five-minute periods

**Key implementation details**:
- Each hourly DAM contract is offset 12 times (every 5 minutes during the hour)
- We SUM all 12 individual P&L calculations (not average them)
- Handles negative energy prices correctly
- Shows interval-by-interval breakdown for transparency

**My approach**: Keep the math simple and transparent. Show the breakdown so users understand where numbers come from.

## UI/UX Decisions

### Dark Theme Trading Interface
**Reasoning**: Professional trading platforms use dark themes - Bloomberg, energy desks, etc. Reduces eye strain during long sessions.

**Color scheme**: Green/red for P&L (standard), blue for prices, yellow for selected data. Clear and functional.

### Information Layout
**Goal**: Put everything traders need on one screen
- Market stats at top (quick overview)
- Price chart in center (main analysis tool)
- Bid entry on right (workflow optimization)
- Positions table below (P&L monitoring)

**Layout rationale**: Mirrors actual trader workflow - monitor prices, enter orders, track P&L.

### Dynamic Chart Controls
**Decision**: Restructured controls with view mode first, then timeframes
**Why**: Prevents data overload by limiting timeframe options based on selected data type

**Flow**: 
1. Select DAM/RTM/Both (determines data complexity)
2. Available timeframes appear (1D/7D/30D for DAM, 1D/7D for RTM/Both)
3. Chart loads appropriate amount of data

**Result**: No more mysterious loading failures, clearer user guidance

### Form Design
**Challenge**: Arco Design's validation caused app crashes
**Solution**: Manual validation with user-friendly notifications instead of error states

**Takeaway**: Sometimes it's better to work around library limitations than fight them.

## What I Prioritized

### Must-haves
1. **Correct P&L math** - This is the core value proposition
2. **11am cutoff enforcement** - Critical business rule
3. **Real market data integration** - Shows API skills
4. **Simple, Clean UI** - Needs to look like something traders would use

### Nice-to-haves I included
- CSV export for data analysis
- Dynamic timeframes (1D/7D for RTM, 1D/7D/30D for DAM)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Responsive design

### What I deliberately skipped
- User authentication (not relevant for this demo)
- Database persistence (in-memory sufficient for take-home)
- Multiple markets (depth over breadth)
- Complex order types (focused on core functionality)

## Reliability Approach

**Philosophy**: Demo needs to work no matter what
- Backend down? Frontend still functions with calculated data
- API rate limited? Smart caching prevents issues
- WebSocket disconnected? Falls back to HTTP polling
- Form validation errors? Graceful handling with clear messages

**Why this approach**: Demos need to work reliably. Better to have a solid, simple implementation than a complex one that fails.

## Code Quality Approach

**TypeScript strict mode**: Zero `any` types. Financial apps need type safety.

**Error handling**: Every API call, every user input, every edge case has proper handling.

**Clean architecture**: Clear separation between business logic, API calls, and UI components.
